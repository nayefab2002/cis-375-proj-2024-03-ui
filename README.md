https://cis-375-proj-2024-03-ui.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

This project is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) / [React](https://react.dev/learn)
/ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) front-end application.

You will need to install Node.js for development. The best way to install Node.js
is with [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

- On Linux & macOS: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
- On Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades
  (_IMPORTANT:_ [run installer as Administrator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50563188/access-denied-issue-with-nvm-in-windows-10))

Once you have installed NVM, open a terminal and run:

```bash
nvm install 20 && corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You can now view the app running in your browser: http://localhost:3000.
